"""Generate the Content-Security-Policy for the built web bundle.

Flutter emits its bootstrap as a large inline <script> in index.html, so a
script-src without 'unsafe-inline' blocks it and the app never starts. The
content of that script changes on every build (it embeds the service worker
version and build config), so a hash committed to the repo would silently
break the next rebuild.

This hashes whatever inline scripts the build actually produced and writes an
nginx snippet defining $csp. Run after `flutter build web`; the output is
included from nginx.conf.

# CanvasKit's font system fetches Roboto and the Noto fallback chain from
# Google at runtime, for glyphs outside the bundled font. --no-web-resources-cdn
# bundles CanvasKit and a local Roboto but does NOT stop this; the engine still
# reaches for fonts.gstatic.com. Blocking it leaves the app with no font data at
# all, so it renders its layout and images and draws no text whatsoever.
#
# This was shipped broken once. It passed review because the browser doing the
# checking had the fonts cached from earlier builds -- warm cache rendered fine,
# cold cache showed a textless page. Verify font changes in a cold context.

# Everything is same-origin except the homeserver: media and avatars are
# fetched from it, and it is the only host the app may talk to. connect-src is
# the directive that matters here -- the access token and E2EE keys live in
# IndexedDB, and the build pulls third-party JS (native_imaging) into this
# origin, so this is what stops either being posted elsewhere.
#
# About script-src, honestly: 'unsafe-eval' is here because dart2js output
# calls eval() and the app renders a blank page without it -- verified by
# toggling it on a built image. 'wasm-unsafe-eval' stays because CanvasKit
# compiles WebAssembly; it is narrower and not implied by 'unsafe-eval'.
#
# That makes script-src the weakest directive in this policy, which is
# tolerable here: CanvasKit paints to a canvas rather than the DOM, so a
# hostile Matrix message is not a DOM-XSS vector. The directives doing real
# work are connect-src, object-src, base-uri and form-action. Escaping
# 'unsafe-eval' would mean compiling to WASM instead of dart2js -- a separate
# piece of work, not a config tweak.
#
# blob: workers and inline styles are likewise Flutter requirements.
