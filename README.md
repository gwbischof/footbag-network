# Footbag Network

A chat and community app for footbag players, built on [Matrix](https://matrix.org).

Footbag Network connects the global footbag community — freestyle, net, and casual
players — in one place. The chat isn't a separate silo: it's the same Matrix network
the community already uses, so the app and the web community are one.

Part of the footbag ecosystem alongside [New York Footbag](https://newyorkfootbag.com)
and the [Modified forum](https://modified.korroni.com).

## Status

Early development. Currently a rebranded Matrix client; footbag-specific features
(finding players near you, progress tracking, club profiles) are in progress.

## Attribution

Footbag Network is a **fork of [FluffyChat](https://github.com/krille-chan/fluffychat)**
by Christian Kußowski and contributors — an excellent open-source Matrix client. We
forked it rather than reinventing a Matrix client from scratch. Please consider
[supporting FluffyChat's development](https://de.liberapay.com/KrilleChritzelius).

## How to build

Requires [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). Some dependencies (the Vodozemac crypto
library) are Rust-based but ship prebuilt — you only need
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you're rebuilding those from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gwbischof/footbag-network.git
cd footbag-network
flutter pub get
```

### Web

```bash
./scripts/prepare-web.sh   # installs Vodozemac (required)
flutter build web --release
```

Run locally with `flutter run -d chrome`.

Optionally configure by serving a `config.json` alongside the app — see
`config.sample.json`. Only include the keys you actually want to override.

### Android

```bash
flutter build apk
```

### iOS / iPadOS

Requires a Mac with Xcode set up for app signing. See `scripts/build-ios.sh`.

### Desktop (Linux, Windows, macOS)

[Enable desktop support](https://flutter.dev/desktop) in Flutter, then:

```bash
flutter build linux --release    # or windows / macos
```

On Linux you'll also need:

```bash
sudo apt install libjsoncpp1 libsecret-1-dev libsecret-1-0 librhash0 libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev lld
```

## Configuration and Mobile Device Management (MDM)

Configurable via MDM on Android and iOS, and via a `config.json` file on web. The
Android MDM schema is at `android/app/src/main/res/xml/app_restrictions.xml`.

## Integration tests

Requires Docker. Run the preparation script before each test run:

```bash
./scripts/prepare_integration_test.sh
flutter test integration_test/mobile_test.dart
```
